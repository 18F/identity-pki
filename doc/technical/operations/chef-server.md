# Working with the Chef Server

This page describes how to do some common chef server administrative tasks.
This page doesn't apply to any instances that are autoscaled, so see [the Life
of an Instance](../life-of-an-instance.md) documentation for how to manage auto
scaled instances.

We no longer run any instances individually provisioned via a chef server, so
this page only remains as a historical marker.
