# Continuous Integration (CI) VPC

We currently have a Dedicated CI (Continuous Integration) VPC for our
integration tests.

This includes our [Instance Tests](instances.md) and some of our [Chef Cookbook
Tests](cookbooks.md) that must run in AWS. The idea here is that this VPC includes only the base infrastructure needed to
run the integration tests, and is not a full production environment.

It is configured in exactly the same way as any other environment, and you can
find the current configuration in
[identity-devops-private](https://github.com/18F/identity-devops-private/blob/master/env/ci.sh).
