# Architecture Decision Record N: Title
_These documents have names that are short noun phrases. For example, "ADR 1: Deployment on Ruby on Rails 3.0.10" or "ADR 9: LDAP for Multitenant Integration"_

> Short description

__Status__: Status
_A decision may be "proposed" if the project stakeholders haven't agreed with it yet, or "accepted" once it is agreed. It can then be moved to "implemented" with reference to the merge request or changeset that implemented it. If a later ADR changes or reverses a decision, it may be marked as "deprecated" or "superseded" with a reference to its replacement._

## Context
_This section describes the forces at play, including technological, political, social, and project local. These forces are probably in tension, and should be called out as such. The language in this section is value-neutral. It is simply describing facts._

## Decision
_This section describes our response to these forces. It is stated in full sentences, with active voice. "We will â€¦"_

## Consequences
_This section describes the resulting context, after applying the decision. All consequences should be listed here, not just the "positive" ones. A particular decision may have positive, negative, and neutral consequences, but all of them affect the team and project in the future._

## Alternatives Considered
_An optional section for describing in detail any alternatives considered and why they were rejected._
