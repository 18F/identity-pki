# s5.26 - \[catalog\] Ensure that container health is checked at runtime

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

You should run the container using the `--health-cmd` parameter.    For example:  ```  docker run -d --health-cmd='stat /etc/passwd || exit 1' nginx  ```

______________________________________________________________________

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

All containers that we are running are short-lived, non-interactive processes in
a batch pipeline. They are ephemeral and exit upon completion, so a heathcheck
would not be useful.
