# s5.26 - \[catalog\] Ensure that container health is checked at runtime

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

You should run the container using the `--health-cmd` parameter.    For example:  ```  docker run -d --health-cmd='stat /etc/passwd || exit 1' nginx  ```

______________________________________________________________________

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

Gitlab does not provide the ability to override this parameter, so we achieve
the equivalent functionality by building our containers with the HEALTHCHECK
instruction. We have documentation on Container Development in our wiki for
this.
