## Control Statement

## Control Objective

You should periodically check your container inventory on each host and clean up containers which are not in active use with the command below:    ```  docker container prune  ```

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

Gitlab containers are short-lived and run as steps in a build process. They are cleaned up after their job is completed.
