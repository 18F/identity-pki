# s3.14 - \[catalog\] Ensure that the Docker server certificate key file permissions are set to 400

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

You should execute the following command:    ```  chmod 400     ```  This sets the Docker server certificate key file permissions to `400`.

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

The docker daemon is not exposed over TCP, but only through the local
unix domain socket.  Thus, there are no certs.
