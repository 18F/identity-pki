# cm-4 - \[catalog\] Security Impact Analysis

## Control Statement

The organization analyzes changes to the information system to determine potential security impacts prior to change implementation.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization analyzes changes to the information system to determine potential security impacts prior to change implementation.

## Control guidance

Organizational personnel with information security responsibilities (e.g., Information System Administrators, Information System Security Officers, Information System Security Managers, and Information System Security Engineers) conduct security impact analyses. Individuals conducting security impact analyses possess the necessary skills/technical expertise to analyze the changes to information systems and the associated security ramifications. Security impact analysis may include, for example, reviewing security plans to understand security control requirements and reviewing system design documentation to understand control implementation and how specific changes might affect the controls. Security impact analyses may also include assessments of risk to better understand the impact of the changes and to determine if additional security controls are required. Security impact analyses are scaled in accordance with the security categories of the information systems.

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

The GitLab component aligns with CM-4 from the main Login.gov SSP.

In addition, our Container Development<sup>1</sup> wiki page has instructions on how to establish trust for a specific image.
