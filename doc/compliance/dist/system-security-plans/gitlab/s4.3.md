# s4.3 - \[catalog\] Ensure that unnecessary packages are not installed in the container

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

You should not install anything within the container that is not required.     You should consider using a minimal base image rather than the standard Redhat/Centos/Debian images if you can. Some of the options available include BusyBox and Alpine.    Not only can this trim your image size considerably, but there would also be fewer pieces of software which could contain vectors for attack.
