# s4.10 - \[catalog\] Ensure secrets are not stored in Dockerfiles

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

Do not store any kind of secrets within Dockerfiles. Where secrets are required during the build process, make use of a secrets management tool, such as the buildkit builder included with Docker.

______________________________________________________________________

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

We do not store secrets within any of our Dockerfiles. We inherit our secrets storage methodology from our SSP.
