# s2.11 - \[catalog\] Ensure that authorization for Docker client commands is enabled

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

Docker authorization is being maintained by the permissions on the docker
socket, which only allows root and members of the docker group to access
it.
