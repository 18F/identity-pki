# sc-10 - \[catalog\] Network Disconnect

## Control Statement

The information system terminates the network connection associated with a communications session at the end of the session or after organization-defined time period of inactivity.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[1\] the organization defines a time period of inactivity after which the information system terminates a network connection associated with a communications session; and

- \[2\] the information system terminates the network connection associated with a communication session at the end of the session or after the organization-defined time period of inactivity.

## Control guidance

This control applies to both internal and external networks. Terminating network connections associated with communications sessions include, for example, de-allocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level, or de-allocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single, operating system-level network connection. Time periods of inactivity may be established by organizations and include, for example, time periods by type of network access or for specific network accesses.

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

Gitlab terminates all network connections when sessions end. AWS ELBs are configured to terminate idle connections after 60 seconds of inactivity.
