# s2.5 - \[catalog\] Ensure aufs storage driver is not used

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

Do not explicitly use `aufs` as storage driver.    For example, do not start Docker daemon as below:  ```  dockerd --storage-driver aufs  ```

______________________________________________________________________

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

We do not enable aufs, and we have a test that checks whether this is
still true.
