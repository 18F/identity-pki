# s8.1.2 - \[catalog\] Use external certificates

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

You can configure your own certificates for UCP either during installation or after installation via the UCP "Admin Settings" user interface.    **Customize certificates during installation:**    1. Create a volume named `ucp-controller-server-certs` on your primary UCP Manager installation node:     ```   docker volume create ucp-controller-server-certs   ```    2. Copy your external certificate authority's public certificate file (ca.pem) and your signed certificate (cert.pem) and key (key.pem) files to the root directory of the volume     ```   cp ca.pem cert.pem key.pem $(docker volume inspect --format '< .Mountpoint >' ucp-controller-server-certs)/   ```    3. Run the UCP installation command with the `--external-server-cert` flag    **Customize certificates post-installation via the "Admin Settings" UI:**    Refer to the instructions at [https://docs.docker.com/datacenter/ucp/2.2/guides/admin/configure/use-your-own-tls-certificates/#configure-ucp-to-use-your-own-tls-certificates-and-keys](https://docs.docker.com/datacenter/ucp/2.2/guides/admin/configure/use-your-own-tls-certificates/#configure-ucp-to-use-your-own-tls-certificates-and-keys) for configuring your own certificates via the UCP UI.
