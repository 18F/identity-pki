# s1.2.2 - \[catalog\] Ensure only trusted users are allowed to control Docker daemon

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

You should remove any untrusted users from the `docker` group. Additionally, you should not create a mapping of sensitive directories from the host to container volumes.

______________________________________________________________________

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

The only user added to the docker group is the gitlab-runner user.

No volumes are mapped to containers by default.
