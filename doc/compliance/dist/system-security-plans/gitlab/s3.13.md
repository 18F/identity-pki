# s3.13 - \[catalog\] Ensure that the Docker server certificate key file ownership is set to root:root

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

You should execute the following command:    ```  chown root:root     ```  This sets the individual ownership and group ownership for the Docker server certificate key file to `root`.

______________________________________________________________________

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

The docker daemon is not exposed over TCP, but only through the local
unix domain socket.  Thus, there are no certs.
