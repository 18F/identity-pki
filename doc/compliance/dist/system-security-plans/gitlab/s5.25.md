# s5.25 - \[catalog\] Ensure that  the container is restricted from acquiring additional privileges

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

You should start your container with the options below:  ```  docker run --rm -it --security-opt=no-new-privileges ubuntu bash  ```

______________________________________________________________________

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

We do not have the ability to start the Gitlab-provided Redis and Postgresql
containers with this option.

We do start our own containers with the `--security-opt=no-newprivileges`
option, and have a test for this.
