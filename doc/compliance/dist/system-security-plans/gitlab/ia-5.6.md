# ia-5.6 - \[catalog\] Protection of Authenticators

## Control Statement

The organization protects authenticators commensurate with the security category of the information to which use of the authenticator permits access.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization protects authenticators commensurate with the security category of the information to which use of the authenticator permits access.

## Control guidance

For information systems containing multiple security categories of information without reliable physical or logical separation between categories, authenticators used to grant access to the systems are protected commensurate with the highest security category of information on the systems.

______________________________________________________________________

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

Protection and classification of authenticators is handled upstream via Login.gov. 
The GitLab component aligns with IA-5(6) from the main Login.gov SSP.
