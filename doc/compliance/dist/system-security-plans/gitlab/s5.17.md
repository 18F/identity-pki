# s5.17 - \[catalog\] Ensure that host devices are not directly exposed to containers

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

You should not directly expose host devices to containers. If you do need to expose host devices to containers, you should use granular permissions as appropriate to your organization:    For example, do not start a container using the command below:  ```  docker run --interactive --tty --device=/dev/tty0:/dev/tty0:rwm --device=/dev/temp_sda:/dev/temp_sda:rwm centos bash  ```    You should only share the host device using appropriate permissions:  ```  docker run --interactive --tty --device=/dev/tty0:/dev/tty0:rw --device=/dev/temp_sda:/dev/temp_sda:r centos bash  ```

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

We do not expose any host devices to containers. We have a test that checks for this.
