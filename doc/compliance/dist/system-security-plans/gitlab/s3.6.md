# s3.6 - \[catalog\] Ensure that /etc/docker directory permissions are set to 755 or more restrictively

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

You should run the following command:  ```  chmod 755 /etc/docker  ```  This sets the permissions for the directory to `755`.

______________________________________________________________________

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

`/etc/docker` is 755 by default.
There is also a test for this that will fail if it goes out of compliance.
