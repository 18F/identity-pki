# s3.11 - \[catalog\] Ensure that Docker server certificate file ownership is set to root:root

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

You should run the following command:  ```  chown root:root     ```  This sets the individual ownership and the group ownership for the Docker server certificate file to `root`.

______________________________________________________________________

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

The docker daemon is not exposed over TCP, but only through the local
unix domain socket.  Thus, there are no certs.
