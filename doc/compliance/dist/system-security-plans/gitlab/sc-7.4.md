# sc-7.4 - \[catalog\] External Telecommunications Services

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a\] Implements a managed interface for each external telecommunication service;

- \[b\] Establishes a traffic flow policy for each managed interface;

- \[c\] Protects the confidentiality and integrity of the information being transmitted across each interface;

- \[d\] Documents each exception to the traffic flow policy with a supporting mission/business need and duration of that need; and

- \[e\] Reviews exceptions to the traffic flow policy organization-defined frequency and removes exceptions that are no longer supported by an explicit mission/business need.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[a_obj\] implements a managed interface for each external telecommunication service;

- \[b_obj\] establishes a traffic flow policy for each managed interface;

- \[c_obj\] protects the confidentiality and integrity of the information being transmitted across each interface;

- \[d_obj\] documents each exception to the traffic flow policy with:

  - \[1\] a supporting mission/business need;
  - \[2\] duration of that need;

- \[e_obj\]

  - \[1\] defines a frequency to review exceptions to traffic flow policy;
  - \[2\] reviews exceptions to the traffic flow policy with the organization-defined frequency; and
  - \[3\] removes traffic flow policy exceptions that are no longer supported by an explicit mission/business need
