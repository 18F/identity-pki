# ar-8 - \[catalog\] Accounting of Disclosures

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

The organization:  a. Keeps an accurate accounting of disclosures of information held in each system of records under its control, including:  (1) Date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure of a record; and  (2) Name and address of the person or agency to which the disclosure was made;  b.Retains the accounting of disclosures for the life of the record or five years after the disclosure is made, whichever is longer; and  c.Makes the accounting of disclosures available to the person named in the record upon request.    The Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) periodically consults with managers of organization systems of record to ensure that the required accountings of disclosures of records are being properly maintained and provided to persons named in those records consistent with the dictates of the Privacy Act. Organizations are not required to keep an accounting of disclosures when the disclosures are made to individuals with a need to know, are made pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, or are made to a law enforcement agency pursuant to 5 U.S.C. ยง 552a(c)(3). Heads of agencies can promulgate rules to exempt certain systems of records from the requirement to provide the accounting of disclosures to individuals.
