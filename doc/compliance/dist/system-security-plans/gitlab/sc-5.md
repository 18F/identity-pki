# sc-5 - \[catalog\] Denial-of-service Protection

## Control Statement

- \[a\]  No value found the effects of the following types of denial-of-service events: organization-defined types of denial-of-service events; and

- \[b\] Employ the following controls to achieve the denial-of-service objective: organization-defined controls by type of denial-of-service event.

## Control guidance

Denial-of-service events may occur due to a variety of internal and external causes, such as an attack by an adversary or a lack of planning to support organizational needs with respect to capacity and bandwidth. Such attacks can occur across a wide range of network protocols (e.g., IPv4, IPv6). A variety of technologies are available to limit or eliminate the origination and effects of denial-of-service events. For example, boundary protection devices can filter certain types of packets to protect system components on internal networks from being directly affected by or the source of denial-of-service attacks. Employing increased network capacity and bandwidth combined with service redundancy also reduces the susceptibility to denial-of-service events.
