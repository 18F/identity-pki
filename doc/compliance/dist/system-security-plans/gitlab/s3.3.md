# s3.3 - \[catalog\] Ensure that docker.socket file ownership is set to root:root

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

**Step 1**: Find out the file location:  ```  systemctl show -p FragmentPath docker.socket  ```    **Step 2**: If the file does not exist, this recommendation is not applicable. If the file exists, execute the command below, including the correct file path to set the ownership and group ownership for the file to `root`.    For example,  ```  chown root:root /usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.socket  ```

______________________________________________________________________

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

`/etc/systemd/system/docker.socket` is owned by root:root by default.
There is also a test for this that will fail if it goes out of compliance.
