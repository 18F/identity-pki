# s1.2.5 - \[catalog\] Ensure auditing is configured for Docker files and directories - /etc/docker

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

You should add a rule for the `/etc/docker` directory.    For example:    Add the line below to the `/etc/audit/audit.rules` file:  ```  -w /etc/docker -k docker   ```  Then restart the audit daemon. For example:  ```  service auditd restart  ```

______________________________________________________________________

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

This is configured by the `template '/etc/audit/rules.d/docker.rules'` resource
in the identity-gitlab cookbook.
