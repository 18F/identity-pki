# s4.7 - \[catalog\] Ensure update instructions are not used alone in Dockerfiles

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

You should use update instructions together with install instructions and version pinning for packages while installing them. This will prevent caching and force the extraction of the required versions.    Alternatively, you could use the `--no-cache` flag during the `docker build` process to avoid using cached layers.

______________________________________________________________________

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

We build our containers with Kaniko, which has caching disabled by
default, so all images are built with no caching.

We also call this out in our Container Development documentation.
