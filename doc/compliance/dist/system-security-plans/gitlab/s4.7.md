# s4.7 - \[catalog\] Ensure update instructions are not used alone in Dockerfiles

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

You should use update instructions together with install instructions and version pinning for packages while installing them. This will prevent caching and force the extraction of the required versions.    Alternatively, you could use the `--no-cache` flag during the `docker build` process to avoid using cached layers.
