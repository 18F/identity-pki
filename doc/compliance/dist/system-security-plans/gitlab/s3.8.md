# s3.8 - \[catalog\] Ensure that registry certificate file permissions are set to 444 or more restrictively

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

You should execute the following command:  ```  chmod 444 /etc/docker/certs.d//*   ```  This would set the permissions for the registry certificate files to `444`.

______________________________________________________________________

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

The docker daemon is not exposed over TCP, but only through the local
unix domain socket.  Thus, there are no certs, and
this directory does not exist.  There is a test that will fail if
this ever changes.
