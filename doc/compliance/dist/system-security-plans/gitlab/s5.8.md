# s5.8 - \[catalog\] Ensure that only needed ports are open on the container

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

You should ensure that the Dockerfile for each container image only exposes needed ports. You can also completely ignore the list of ports defined in the Dockerfile by **NOT** using `-P` (UPPERCASE) or the `--publish-all` flag when starting the container. Instead, use the `-p` (lowercase) or `--publish` flag to explicitly define the ports that you need for a particular container instance.    For example:  ```  docker run --interactive --tty --publish 5000 --publish 5001 --publish 5002 centos /bin/bash  ```
