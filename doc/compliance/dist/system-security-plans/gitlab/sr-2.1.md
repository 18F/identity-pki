# sr-2.1 - \[catalog\] Establish Scrm Team

## Control Statement

Establish a supply chain risk management team consisting of [Assignment: organizationdefined personnel, roles, and responsibilities] to lead and support the following SCRM activities: [Assignment: organization-defined supply chain risk management activities].

## Control guidance

To implement supply chain risk management plans, organizations establish a coordinated, team-based approach to identify and assess supply chain risks and manage these risks by using programmatic and technical mitigation techniques. The team approach enables organizations to conduct an analysis of their supply chain, communicate with internal and external partners or stakeholders, and gain broad consensus regarding the appropriate resources for SCRM. The SCRM team consists of organizational personnel with diverse roles and responsibilities for leading and supporting SCRM activities, including risk executive, information technology, contracting, information security, privacy, mission or business, legal, supply chain and logistics, acquisition, business continuity, and other relevant functions. Members of the SCRM team are involved in various aspects of the SDLC and, collectively, have an awareness of and provide expertise in acquisition processes, legal practices, vulnerabilities, threats, and attack vectors, as well as an understanding of the technical aspects and dependencies of systems. The SCRM team can be an extension of the security and privacy risk management processes or be included as part of an organizational risk management team.

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

GSA has developed and documented IT Security Policies and Procedures, including SCRM policies and procedures; these documents are made available to GSA employees (and contractors, as may be appropriate), on GSAâ€™s InSite. The LG system is subject to GSA policies and procedures, described below.

Policies, Regulations, and Laws (specific InSite page): https://insite.gsa.gov/employee-resources/acquisition-purchases-and-payments/acquisition-portal/acquisition-by-topic/cybersupply-chain-risk-management-cscrm/cscrm-policies-regulations-and-laws.

Procedures (specific InSite page): https://insite.gsa.gov/cdnstatic/insite/Cyber-Supply-Chain-Risk-Management_OCISO-%28C-SCRM%29-Program-%5BCIO-IT-Security-21-117-Initial-Release%5D.pdf. 

[TBD] Additionally LG team adheres to GSA policies as shared responsibilites across the GSA organization from CIO, CISO to the system owners. Gitlab is the platform that assists our security analysts in this capacity where SCRM security in part of establishing trusted software SDLC with continuous security inspection (SAST, DAST) against LG application source code and dependencies from supply chain. This is coupled with LG's CI/CD pipeline promotion process.
