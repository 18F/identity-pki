# si-4.4 - \[catalog\] Inbound and Outbound Communications Traffic

## Control Statement

The information system monitors inbound and outbound communications traffic organization-defined frequency for unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[1\] defines a frequency to monitor:

  - \[a\] inbound communications traffic for unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions;
  - \[b\] outbound communications traffic for unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions;

- \[2\] monitors, with the organization-defined frequency:

  - \[a\] inbound communications traffic for unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions; and
  - \[b\] outbound communications traffic for unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions.

## Control guidance

Unusual/unauthorized activities or conditions related to information system inbound and outbound communications traffic include, for example, internal traffic that indicates the presence of malicious code within organizational information systems or propagating among system components, the unauthorized exporting of information, or signaling to external information systems. Evidence of malicious code is used to identify potentially compromised information systems or information system components.
