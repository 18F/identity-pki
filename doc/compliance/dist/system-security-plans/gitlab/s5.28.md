# s5.28 - \[catalog\] Ensure that the PIDs cgroup limit is used

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

Use `--pids-limit` flag with an appropriate value when launching the container.    For example:  ```  docker run -it --pids-limit 100   ```  In the above example, the number of processes allowed to run at any given time is set to 100. After a limit of 100 concurrently running processes is reached, Docker would restrict any new process creation.
