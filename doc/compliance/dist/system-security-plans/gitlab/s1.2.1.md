# s1.2.1 - \[catalog\] Ensure a separate partition for containers has been created

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

For new installations, you should create a separate partition for the `/var/lib/docker` mount point. For systems which have already been installed, you should use the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) within Linux to create a new partition.

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

/var/lib/docker is on a separate /var partition so that even if it
gets filled up, regular system functions are able to continue.  Note:
other critical /var subdirectories such as /var/log, /var/tmp, and
/var/log/audit are also their own volumes.
