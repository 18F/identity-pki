# s3.5 - \[catalog\] Ensure that the /etc/docker directory ownership is set to root:root

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

To resolve this issue you should run the following command:    ```  chown root:root /etc/docker  ```  This sets the ownership and group ownership for the directory to `root`.

______________________________________________________________________

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

`/etc/docker` is owned by root:root by default if it exists.
There is also a test for this that will fail if it goes out of compliance.
