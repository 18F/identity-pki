# s2.1 - \[catalog\] Ensure network traffic is restricted between containers on the default bridge

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

Edit the Docker daemon configuration file to ensure that icc is disabled. It should include the following setting     ```  "icc": false  ```    Alernatively, run the docker daemon directly and pass `--icc=false` as an argument.    For Example,  ```  dockerd --icc=false  ```    Alternatively, you can follow the Docker documentation and create a custom network and only join containers that need to communicate to that custom network. The `--icc` parameter only applies to the default docker bridge, if custom networks are used then the approach of segmenting networks should be adopted instead.
