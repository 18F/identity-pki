# di-1 - \[catalog\] Data Quality

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

The organization:  a.Confirms to the greatest extent practicable upon collection or creation of personally identifiable information (PII), the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness of that information;  b.Collects PII directly from the individual to the greatest extent practicable;  c.Checks for, and corrects as necessary, any inaccurate or outdated PII used by its programs or systems [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and  d.Issues guidelines ensuring and maximizing the quality, utility, objectivity, and integrity of disseminated information.    Organizations take reasonable steps to confirm the accuracy and relevance of PII. Such steps may include, for example, editing and validating addresses as they are collected or entered into information systems using automated address verification look-up application programming interfaces (API). The types of measures taken to protect data quality are based on the nature and context of the PII, how it is to be used, and how it was obtained. Measures taken to validate the accuracy of PII that is used to make determinations about the rights, benefits, or privileges of individuals under federal programs may be more comprehensive than those used to validate less sensitive PII. Additional steps may be necessary to validate PII that is obtained from sources other than individuals or the authorized representatives of individuals.  When PII is of a sufficiently sensitive nature (e.g., when it is used for annual reconfirmation of a taxpayerâ€™s income for a recurring benefit), organizations incorporate mechanisms into information systems and develop corresponding procedures for how frequently, and by what method, the information is to be updated.
