# s4.8 - \[catalog\] Ensure setuid and setgid permissions are removed

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

You should allow setuid and setgid permissions only on executables which require them. You could remove these permissions at build time by adding the following command in your Dockerfile, preferably towards the end of the Dockerfile:  ```  RUN find / -perm /6000 -type f -exec chmod a-s {} \; || true   ```
