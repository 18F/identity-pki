# s4.8 - \[catalog\] Ensure setuid and setgid permissions are removed

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

You should allow setuid and setgid permissions only on executables which require them. You could remove these permissions at build time by adding the following command in your Dockerfile, preferably towards the end of the Dockerfile:  ```  RUN find / -perm /6000 -type f -exec chmod a-s {} \; || true   ```

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

We have documentation on Container Development in our wiki that
recommends this.
