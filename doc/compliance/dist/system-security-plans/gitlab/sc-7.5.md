# sc-7.5 - \[catalog\] Deny by Default â€” Allow by Exception

## Control Statement

Deny network communications traffic by default and allow network communications traffic by exception No value found.

## Control guidance

Denying by default and allowing by exception applies to inbound and outbound network communications traffic. A deny-all, permit-by-exception network communications traffic policy ensures that only those system connections that are essential and approved are allowed. Deny by default, allow by exception also applies to a system that is connected to an external system.
