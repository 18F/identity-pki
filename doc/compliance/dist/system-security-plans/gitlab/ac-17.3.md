# ac-17.3 - \[catalog\] Managed Access Control Points

## Control Statement

The information system routes all remote accesses through organization-defined number managed network access control points.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[1\] the organization defines the number of managed network access control points through which all remote accesses are to be routed; and

- \[2\] the information system routes all remote accesses through the organization-defined number of managed network access control points.

## Control guidance

Limiting the number of access control points for remote accesses reduces the attack surface for organizations. Organizations consider the Trusted Internet Connections (TIC) initiative requirements for external network connections.

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

All access to gitlab is through a single unique AWS load balancer, and
access to that load balancer is limited to users of the GSA VPN.
