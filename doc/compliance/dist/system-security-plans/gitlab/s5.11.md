# s5.11 - \[catalog\] Ensure that CPU priority is set appropriately on containers

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

You should manage the CPU runtime between your containers dependent on their priority within your organization. To do so start the container using the `--cpu-shares` argument.     For example, you could run a container as below:  ```  docker run --interactive --tty --cpu-shares 512 centos /bin/bash  ```    In the example above, the container is started with CPU shares of 50% of what other containers use. So if the other container has CPU shares of 80%, this container will have CPU shares of 40%.    Every new container will have `1024` shares of CPU by default. However, this value is shown as `0` if you run the command mentioned in the audit section.    Alternatively:    1. Navigate to the `/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/system.slice/` directory.  2. Check your container instance ID using `docker ps`.  3. Inside the above directory (in step 1), you could have a directory called, for example: `docker-.scope`. For example, `docker-4acae729e8659c6be696ee35b2237cc1fe4edd2672e9186434c5116e1a6fbed6.scope`. Navigate to this directory.  4. You will find a file named `cpu.shares`. Execute `cat cpu.shares`. This will always give you the CPU share value based on the system. Even if there are no CPU shares configured using the `-c` or `--cpu-shares` argument in the `docker run` command, this file will have a value of `1024`.    If you set one containerâ€™s CPU shares to `512` it will receive half of the CPU time compared to the other containers. So if you take `1024` as 100% you can then derive the number that you should set for respective CPU shares. For example, use `512` if you want to set it to 50% and `256` if you want to set it 25%.
