# sr-11.2 - \[catalog\] Configuration Control for Component Service and Repair

## Control Statement

Maintain configuration control over the following system components awaiting service or repair and serviced or repaired components awaiting return to service: organization-defined system components.

## Control guidance

None.

______________________________________________________________________

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

This is an inherited control as our cloud service infrastructure provider (AWS) operates the physical hardware and thus configuration control for service and repair is on their end.
