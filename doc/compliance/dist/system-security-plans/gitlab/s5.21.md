# s5.21 - \[catalog\] Ensure the default seccomp profile is not Disabled

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

By default, seccomp profiles are enabled. You do not need to do anything unless you want to modify and use a modified seccomp profile.

______________________________________________________________________

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

We do not disable the default seccomp profile, and have a test to verify this.
