# s3.21 - \[catalog\] Ensure that the /etc/sysconfig/docker file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictively

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

You should execute the following command:  ```  chmod 644 /etc/sysconfig/docker  ```  This sets the file permissions for this file to `644`.

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

/etc/sysconfig/docker is not installed, and we have a test that will
fail if it ever appears.
