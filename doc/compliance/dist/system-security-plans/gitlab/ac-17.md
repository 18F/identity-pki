# ac-17 - \[catalog\] Remote Access

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a\] Establishes and documents usage restrictions, configuration/connection requirements, and implementation guidance for each type of remote access allowed; and

- \[b\] Authorizes remote access to the information system prior to allowing such connections.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[a_obj\]

  - \[1\] identifies the types of remote access allowed to the information system;
  - \[2\] establishes for each type of remote access allowed:

    - \[a\] usage restrictions;
    - \[b\] configuration/connection requirements;
    - \[c\] implementation guidance;

  - \[3\] documents for each type of remote access allowed:

    - \[a\] usage restrictions;
    - \[b\] configuration/connection requirements;
    - \[c\] implementation guidance; and

- \[b_obj\] authorizes remote access to the information system prior to allowing such connections.

## Control guidance

Remote access is access to organizational information systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) communicating through external networks (e.g., the Internet). Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations often employ encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) to enhance confidentiality and integrity over remote connections. The use of encrypted VPNs does not make the access non-remote; however, the use of VPNs, when adequately provisioned with appropriate security controls (e.g., employing appropriate encryption techniques for confidentiality and integrity protection) may provide sufficient assurance to the organization that it can effectively treat such connections as internal networks. Still, VPN connections traverse external networks, and the encrypted VPN does not enhance the availability of remote connections. Also, VPNs with encrypted tunnels can affect the organizational capability to adequately monitor network communications traffic for malicious code. Remote access controls apply to information systems other than public web servers or systems designed for public access. This control addresses authorization prior to allowing remote access without specifying the formats for such authorization. While organizations may use interconnection security agreements to authorize remote access connections, such agreements are not required by this control. Enforcing access restrictions for remote connections is addressed in AC-3.

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

<!-- Please leave this section blank and enter implementation details in the parts below. -->

______________________________________________________________________

## Implementation a.

### GSA VPN

Only properly authenticated users coming in over the GSA VPN are allowed to
attempt to use the administrative functions of the gitlab system.  Thus, we
inherit the GSA VPN controls.

The two ports that are exposed to GSA VPN users are:
* The https port (443) for administrative gitlab web ui access
* The ssh port (22) for gitlab git-ssh access.

### AWS PrivateLink

Systems authenticated via ssh keys are allowed to access git-ssh on port 22 via
AWS PrivateLink tunnels established between our login.gov VPCs.

### Other

Users not coming over VPN are allowed access to non-administrative areas of
Gitlab, provided they have authenticated with Login.gov and have a preexisting
Gitlab account.

______________________________________________________________________

## Implementation b.

### GSA VPN

All users are authorized to try to authenticte with login.gov and use gitlab
services via https.

Users able to authenticate with the GSA VPN are authorized to try to authenticte
with and use gitlab services via https or git-ssh.

Gitlab maintains its own list of users and what they are authorized to do, and
thus not all users, GSA VPN or otherwise, are able to authenticate and use
gitlab services.  This list is maintained by a script that runs periodically to
add/delete users and their group membership using the same user config file that
configures our AWS IAM users.

Individual users configure their own ssh keys to authorize them to
use git-ssh in addition to the web UI over https.

### AWS PrivateLink

All systems which present ssh keys over the AWS PrivateLink tunnels
that have been authorized inside gitlab are able to use git-ssh on
the repos that the keys are authorized for.
