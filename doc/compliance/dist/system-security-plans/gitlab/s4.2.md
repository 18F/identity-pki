# s4.2 - \[catalog\] Ensure that containers use only trusted base images

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

The following procedures are useful for establishing trust for a specific image.    - Configure and use Docker Content trust.  - View the history of each Docker image to evaluate its risk, dependent on the sensitivity of the application you wish to deploy using it.  - Scan Docker images for vulnerabilities at regular intervals.

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

Gitlab is installed from packages, so there are no images for it.

We have documentation on Container Development in our wiki that
requests that our container developers review images for security
issues and sign them with Cosign.

All images that we are using are scanned by AWS because they are pulled
through the ECR pull-through cache.  The images are continuously scanned
by their Enhanced Scanning functionality.

DCT is not going to be implemented at this time.  As of this time,
the standard way to cryptographically sign a Docker image 
is with the 'docker trust' subcommand against a Docker image repository that 
implements the Docker Notary v1 standard.  Currently this is limited to the
Docker Notary stand-alone server or DockerHub.

Thus, we are using Cosign and a KMS key to sign trusted images
and kill images that are not signed on runners.
