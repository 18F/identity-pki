# s4.2 - \[catalog\] Ensure that containers use only trusted base images

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

The following procedures are useful for establishing trust for a specific image.    - Configure and use Docker Content trust.  - View the history of each Docker image to evaluate its risk, dependent on the sensitivity of the application you wish to deploy using it.  - Scan Docker images for vulnerabilities at regular intervals.

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

This control is not going to be implemented at this time.  

As of this time, the standard way to cryptographically sign a Docker image is with the 'docker trust' subcommand against a Docker image repository that implements the Docker Notary v1 standard.  Currently this is limited to the Docker Notary stand-alone server or DockerHub.  As the Docker Notary v2 standard is being finalized and currently in the alpha stage, and AWS ECR does not currently support any version of the Docker Notary, we will revisit this control when one or both of these conditions changes.
