# s8.1.5 - \[catalog\] Enable signed image enforcement

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

Running untrusted containers poses a risk to the operation of your Docker platform. Combined with the Docker Content Trust recommendations in Section 4, signed image enforcement in UCP gives you more control over the validity and origination of your Docker images prior to deployment. Signed image enforcement can prohibit images that are unsigned, have malformed signatures, and/or compromised signatures from being deployed.
