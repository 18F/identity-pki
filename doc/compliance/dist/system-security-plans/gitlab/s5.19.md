# s5.19 - \[catalog\] Ensure mount propagation mode is not set to shared

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

Do not mount volumes in shared mode propagation.    For example, do not start a container as below:    ```  docker run  --volume=/hostPath:/containerPath:shared     ```

______________________________________________________________________

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

We do not mount any volumes in shared mode propagation, and have a test that verifies this.
