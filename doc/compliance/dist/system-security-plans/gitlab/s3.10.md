# s3.10 - \[catalog\] Ensure that TLS CA certificate file permissions are set to 444 or more restrictively

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

You should execute the following command:    ```  chmod 444     ```  This sets the file permissions on the TLS CA file to `444`.

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

The docker daemon is not exposed over TCP, but only through the local
unix domain socket.  Thus, there are no certs.
