# s3.7 - \[catalog\] Ensure that registry certificate file ownership is set to root:root

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

The following command could be executed:  ```  chown root:root /etc/docker/certs.d//*   ```  This would set the individual ownership and group ownership for the registry certificate files to `root`.

______________________________________________________________________

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

The docker daemon is not exposed over TCP, but only through the local
unix domain socket.  Thus, there are no certs, and
this directory does not exist.  There is a test that will fail if
this ever changes.
