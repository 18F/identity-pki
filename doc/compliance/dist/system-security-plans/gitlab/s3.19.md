# s3.19 - \[catalog\] Ensure that the /etc/default/docker file ownership is set to root:root

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

You should execute the following command  ```  chown root:root /etc/default/docker  ```  This sets the ownership and group ownership of the file to `root`.

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

This is implemented automatically by the docker cookbook, and there is
a test that will fail if this ever changes.
