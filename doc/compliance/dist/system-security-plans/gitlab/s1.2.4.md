# s1.2.4 - \[catalog\] Ensure auditing is configured for Docker files and directories - /var/lib/docker

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

You should add a rule for the `/var/lib/docker` directory.    For example,    Add the line as below to the `/etc/audit/audit.rules` file:  ```  -w /var/lib/docker -k docker   ```  Then restart the audit daemon.     For example,  ```  service auditd restart  ```

______________________________________________________________________

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

This is configured by the `template '/etc/audit/rules.d/docker.rules'` resource
in the identity-gitlab cookbook.
