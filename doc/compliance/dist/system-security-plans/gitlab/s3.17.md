# s3.17 - \[catalog\] Ensure that the daemon.json file ownership is set to root:root

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

You should execute the command below:  ```  chown root:root /etc/docker/daemon.json  ```  This sets the ownership and group ownership for the file to `root`.

______________________________________________________________________

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

There is no `daemon.json` file, since the docker daemon is configured
entirely through the commandline that is used to launch it.
