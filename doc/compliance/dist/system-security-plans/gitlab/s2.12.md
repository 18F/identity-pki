# s2.12 - \[catalog\] Ensure centralized and remote logging is configured

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

**Step 1**: Set up the desired log driver following its documentation.    **Step 2**: Start the docker daemon using that logging driver.    For example:  ```  dockerd --log-driver=syslog --log-opt syslog-address=tcp://192.xxx.xxx.xxx  ```

______________________________________________________________________

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

Logging is going to syslog by default.  We have increased dockerd logging
levels to debug so that we can see container creation messages for more
auditability in the runners recipe in the identity-gitlab cookbook.
