# s5.12 - \[catalog\] Ensure that the container's root filesystem is mounted as read only

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

You should add a `--read-only` flag at a container's runtime to enforce the container's root filesystem being mounted as read only.     ```  docker run  --read-only    ```    Enabling the `--read-only` option at a container's runtime should be used by administrators to force a container's executable processes to only write container data to explicit storage locations during its lifetime.    Examples of explicit storage locations during a container's runtime include, but are not limited to:     1. Using the `--tmpfs` option to mount a temporary file system for non-persistent data writes.     ```  docker run --interactive --tty --read-only --tmpfs "/run" --tmpfs "/tmp" centos /bin/bash  ```     2. Enabling Docker `rw` mounts at a container's runtime to persist container data directly on the Docker host filesystem.     ```  docker run --interactive --tty --read-only -v /opt/app/data:/run/app/data:rw centos /bin/bash  ```     3. Utilizing the Docker shared-storage volume plugin for Docker data volume to persist container data.     ```  docker volume create -d convoy --opt o=size=20GB my-named-volume  ```    ```  docker run --interactive --tty --read-only -v my-named-volume:/run/app/data centos /bin/bash  ```    3. Transmitting container data outside of the Docker controlled area during the container's runtime for container data in order to ensure that it is persistent. Examples include hosted databases, network file shares and APIs.
