# sr-10 - \[catalog\] Inspection of Systems or Components

## Control Statement

Inspect the following systems or system components at random to detect tampering: organization-defined systems or system components.

## Control guidance

The inspection of systems or systems components for tamper resistance and detection addresses physical and logical tampering and is applied to systems and system components removed from organization-controlled areas. Indications of a need for inspection include changes in packaging, specifications, factory location, or entity in which the part is purchased, and when individuals return from travel to high-risk locations.

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

This is an inherited control as our cloud service infrastructure provider (AWS) operates the physical hardware and the hypervisor layer.
