# s1.2.6 - \[catalog\] Ensure auditing is configured for Docker files and directories - docker.service

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

If the file exists, a rule for it should be added.    For example:    Add the line as below in `/etc/audit/audit.rules` file:  ```  -w /usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service -k docker   ```  Then restart the audit daemon.     For example:  ```  service auditd restart  ```

______________________________________________________________________

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

This is configured by the `template '/etc/audit/rules.d/30-login-gov-docker.rules'` resource
in the docker recipe in the harden cookbook in the identity-base-image repo.
