# s2.3 - \[catalog\] Ensure Docker is allowed to make changes to iptables

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

Do not run the Docker daemon with `--iptables=false` parameter. For example, do not start the Docker daemon as below:  ```  dockerd --iptables=false  ```

______________________________________________________________________

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

iptables=false has not been set in our environment.  We have a test
that checks for this.
