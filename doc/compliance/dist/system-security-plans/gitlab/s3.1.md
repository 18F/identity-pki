# s3.1 - \[catalog\] Ensure that the docker.service file ownership is set to root:root

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

**Step 1**: Find out the file location:  ```  systemctl show -p FragmentPath docker.service  ```    **Step 2**: If the file does not exist, this recommendation is not applicable. If the file does exist, you should execute the command below, including the correct file path, in order to set the ownership and group ownership for the file to `root`.    For example,  ```  chown root:root /usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service  ```
