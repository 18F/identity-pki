# s3.9 - \[catalog\] Ensure that TLS CA certificate file ownership is set to root:root

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

You should execute the following command:    ```  chown root:root     ```  This sets the individual ownership and group ownership for the TLS CA certificate file to `root`.

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

Docker is only exposed locally through unix domain sockets, thus there are no SSL certs.
