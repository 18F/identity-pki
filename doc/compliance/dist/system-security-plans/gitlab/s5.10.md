# s5.10 - \[catalog\] Ensure that the memory usage for containers is limited

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

You should run the container with only as much memory as it requires by using the `--memory` argument.     For example, you could run a container using the command below:  ```  docker run --interactive --tty --memory 256m centos /bin/bash  ```  In the example above, the container is started with a memory limit of 256 MB.    Note that the output of the command below returns values in scientific notation if memory limits are in place.  ```  docker inspect --format='<.Config.Memory>' 7c5a2d4c7fe0  ```    For example, if the memory limit is set to `256 MB` for a container instance, the output of the command above would be `2.68435456e+08` and NOT 256m. You should convert this value using a scientific calculator.
