# sa-10 - \[catalog\] Developer Configuration Management

## Control Statement

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to:

- \[a\] Perform configuration management during system, component, or service No value found;

- \[b\] Document, manage, and control the integrity of changes to organization-defined configuration items under configuration management;

- \[c\] Implement only organization-approved changes to the system, component, or service;

- \[d\] Document approved changes to the system, component, or service and the potential security impacts of such changes; and

- \[e\] Track security flaws and flaw resolution within the system, component, or service and report findings to organization-defined personnel.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[a_obj\] requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to perform configuration management during one or more of the following:

  - \[1\] system, component, or service design;
  - \[2\] system, component, or service development;
  - \[3\] system, component, or service implementation; and/or
  - \[4\] system, component, or service operation;

- \[b_obj\]

  - \[1\] defines configuration items to be placed under configuration management;
  - \[2\] requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to:

    - \[a\] document the integrity of changes to organization-defined items under configuration management;
    - \[b\] manage the integrity of changes to organization-defined items under configuration management;
    - \[c\] control the integrity of changes to organization-defined items under configuration management;

- \[c_obj\] requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to implement only organization-approved changes to the system, component, or service;

- \[d_obj\] requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to document:

  - \[1\] approved changes to the system, component, or service;
  - \[2\] the potential security impacts of such changes;

- \[e_obj\]

  - \[1\] defines personnel to whom findings, resulting from security flaws and flaw resolution tracked within the system, component, or service, are to be reported;
  - \[2\] requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to:

    - \[a\] track security flaws within the system, component, or service;
    - \[b\] track security flaw resolution within the system, component, or service; and
    - \[c\] report findings to organization-defined personnel.

## Control guidance

This control also applies to organizations conducting internal information systems development and integration. Organizations consider the quality and completeness of the configuration management activities conducted by developers as evidence of applying effective security safeguards. Safeguards include, for example, protecting from unauthorized modification or destruction, the master copies of all material used to generate security-relevant portions of the system hardware, software, and firmware. Maintaining the integrity of changes to the information system, information system component, or information system service requires configuration control throughout the system development life cycle to track authorized changes and prevent unauthorized changes. Configuration items that are placed under configuration management (if existence/use is required by other security controls) include: the formal model; the functional, high-level, and low-level design specifications; other design data; implementation documentation; source code and hardware schematics; the running version of the object code; tools for comparing new versions of security-relevant hardware descriptions and software/firmware source code with previous versions; and test fixtures and documentation. Depending on the mission/business needs of organizations and the nature of the contractual relationships in place, developers may provide configuration management support during the operations and maintenance phases of the life cycle.

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

<!-- Please leave this section blank and enter implementation details in the parts below. -->

______________________________________________________________________

## Implementation a.

Login.gov uses Terraform and Chef to manage all aspects of the
configuration of the GitLab systems.

______________________________________________________________________

## Implementation b.

The components under configuration management are:

| Component          | Description                                 | How is CM applied |
| -----------        | -----------                                 | -----------       |
| Login.gov Platform | networking, security groups, IAM roles, etc. | The GitLab component aligns with SA-10 from the main Login.gov SSP. |
| GitLab Databases   | AWS RDS Postgres/Redis servers              | Terraform uses code to specify how these are set up and who can connect to them. |
| GitLab Server      | Main GitLab application server              | Terraform uses code to specify how the system is launched, what security groups and IAM roles it has, etc.  Once launched, the system uses chef to install and configure Gitlab and all other tools used to manage it. |
| GitLab Runner      | Executes CI/CD tasks for GitLab             | Terraform uses code to specify how the system is launched, what security groups and IAM roles it has, etc.  Once launched, the system uses chef to install and configure GitLab and all other tools used to manage it. |
| outbound proxies   | Squid servers for enforcing outbound filtering | The GitLab component aligns with sa-10 from the main Login.gov SSP. |

All GitLab Configuration Management processes operate off of code that is
checked out of the identity-devops git repo, where all changes are documented
with pull/merge requests.  Approvals of pull/merge requests are required from
other DevSecOps team members for changes to be incorporated.

All GitLab terraform changes are applied by the GitLab Staging cluster,
which can be triggered manually by an admin after a successful deploy of
the Staging cluster by the GitLab Production cluster.  It runs terraform to
ensure the infrastructure is properly configured and
relaunches all ec2 instances to ensure that chef changes have been
applied.

______________________________________________________________________

## Implementation c.

The GitLab component aligns with SA-10, part C from the main Login.gov SSP.

______________________________________________________________________

## Implementation d.

The GitLab component aligns with SA-10, part D from the main Login.gov SSP.

______________________________________________________________________

## Implementation e.

The GitLab component aligns with SA-10, part E from the main Login.gov SSP.
