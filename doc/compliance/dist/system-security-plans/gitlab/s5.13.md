# s5.13 - \[catalog\] Ensure that incoming container traffic is bound to a specific host interface

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

You should bind the container port to a specific host interface on the desired host port.

For example,

```  docker run --detach --publish 10.2.3.4:49153:80 nginx  ```

In the example above, the container port `80` is bound to the host port on `49153` and would accept incoming connection only from the `10.2.3.4` external interface.

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

No container ports are bound to any host interfaces. We have a test that checks for this.
