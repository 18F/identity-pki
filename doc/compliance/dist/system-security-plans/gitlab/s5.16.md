# s5.16 - \[catalog\] Ensure that the host's IPC namespace is not shared

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

You should not start a container with the `--ipc=host` argument. For example, do not start a container as below:    ```  docker run --interactive --tty --ipc=host centos /bin/bash  ```

______________________________________________________________________

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

We do not start containers with this argument. We have a test that checks for this.
