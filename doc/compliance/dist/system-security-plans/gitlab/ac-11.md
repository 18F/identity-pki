# ac-11 - \[catalog\] Session Lock

## Control Statement

The information system:

- \[a\] Prevents further access to the system by initiating a session lock after organization-defined time period of inactivity or upon receiving a request from a user; and

- \[b\] Retains the session lock until the user reestablishes access using established identification and authentication procedures.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[a_obj\]

  - \[1\] the organization defines the time period of user inactivity after which the information system initiates a session lock;
  - \[2\] the information system prevents further access to the system by initiating a session lock after organization-defined time period of user inactivity or upon receiving a request from a user; and

- \[b_obj\] the information system retains the session lock until the user reestablishes access using established identification and authentication procedures.

## Control guidance

Session locks are temporary actions taken when users stop work and move away from the immediate vicinity of information systems but do not want to log out because of the temporary nature of their absences. Session locks are implemented where session activities can be determined. This is typically at the operating system level, but can also be at the application level. Session locks are not an acceptable substitute for logging out of information systems, for example, if organizations require users to log out at the end of workdays.

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

<!-- Please leave this section blank and enter implementation details in the parts below. -->

______________________________________________________________________

## Implementation a.

Gitlab implements session timeout controls in the [Account and Limit Settings](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/admin_area/settings/account_and_limit_settings.html)
page.  The default is 7 days, and the session is invalid after that.
A user can also manually invalidate a session by logging out of gitlab,
or by manually terminating sessions in the
[Active Sessions List](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/active_sessions.html)

In addition, we inherit the relevant GSA VPN controls.

______________________________________________________________________

## Implementation b.

When the gitlab session times out or the user logs out, the user must
log back in again.

In addition, we inherit the relevant GSA VPN controls.
