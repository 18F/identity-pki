# s5.27 - \[catalog\] Ensure that Docker commands always make use of the latest version of their image

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

You should use proper version pinning mechanisms (the "latest" tag which is assigned by default is still vulnerable to caching attacks) to avoid extracting cached older versions. Version pinning mechanisms should be used for base images, packages, and entire images. You can customize version pinning rules according to your requirements.

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

We pin our built images using the SHA-256 digest of the image, calculated at
build time.
