# s6.1 - \[catalog\] Ensure that image sprawl is avoided

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

You should keep only the images that you actually need and establish a workflow to remove old or stale images from the host. Additionally, you should use features such as pull-by-digest to get specific images from the registry.    You can follow the steps below to find unused images on the system so they can be deleted.    **Step 1** Make a list of all image IDs that are currently instantiated by executing the command below:    ```  docker images --quiet | xargs docker inspect --format '< .Id >: Image=< .Config.Image >'  ```    **Step 2**: List all the images present on the system by executing the command below:  ```  docker images  ```    **Step 3**: Compare the list of image IDs created from Step 1 and Step 2 to find out images which are currently not being instantiated.    **Step 4**: Decide if you want to keep the images that are not currently in use. If they are not needed, delete them by executing the following command:  ```  docker rmi $IMAGE_ID  ```    Alternatively, the `docker system prune` command can be used to remove dangling images which are not tagged or, if necessary, all images that are not currently used by a running container when used with the `-a` option.
