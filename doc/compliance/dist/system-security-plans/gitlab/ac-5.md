# ac-5 - \[catalog\] Separation of Duties

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a\] Separates organization-defined duties of individuals;

- \[b\] Documents separation of duties of individuals; and

- \[c\] Defines information system access authorizations to support separation of duties.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[a_obj\]

  - \[1\] defines duties of individuals to be separated;
  - \[2\] separates organization-defined duties of individuals;

- \[b_obj\] documents separation of duties; and

- \[c_obj\] defines information system access authorizations to support separation of duties.

## Control guidance

Separation of duties addresses the potential for abuse of authorized privileges and helps to reduce the risk of malevolent activity without collusion. Separation of duties includes, for example: (i) dividing mission functions and information system support functions among different individuals and/or roles; (ii) conducting information system support functions with different individuals (e.g., system management, programming, configuration management, quality assurance and testing, and network security); and (iii) ensuring security personnel administering access control functions do not also administer audit functions.
