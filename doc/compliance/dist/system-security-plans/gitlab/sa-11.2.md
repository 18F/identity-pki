# sa-11.2 - \[catalog\] Threat and Vulnerability Analyses

## Control Statement

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to perform threat and vulnerability analyses and subsequent testing/evaluation of the as-built system, component, or service.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to perform:

- \[1\] threat analyses of the as-built, system component, or service;

- \[2\] vulnerability analyses of the as-built, system component, or service; and

- \[3\] subsequent testing/evaluation of the as-built, system component, or service.

## Control guidance

Applications may deviate significantly from the functional and design specifications created during the requirements and design phases of the system development life cycle. Therefore, threat and vulnerability analyses of information systems, system components, and information system services prior to delivery are critical to the effective operation of those systems, components, and services. Threat and vulnerability analyses at this phase of the life cycle help to ensure that design or implementation changes have been accounted for, and that any new vulnerabilities created as a result of those changes have been reviewed and mitigated.
