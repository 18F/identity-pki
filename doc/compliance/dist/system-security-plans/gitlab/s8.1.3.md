# s8.1.3 - \[catalog\] Enforce the use of client certificate bundles for unprivileged users

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

Client certificate bundles can be created in one of two ways:    **User Management UI**    UCP Administrators can provision client certificate bundles on behalf of users by navigating to the USER MANAGEMENT | USERS interface in UCP, selecting the user from the list, clicking on the "Configure" button from the right-hand navigation, and selecting "Client Bundle" from the drop-down. The "New Client Bundle" link can be selected to create a client bundle. This will trigger a download of the bundle as a .zip file.     **Self-Provision**    Users with access to the UCP console can create client certificate bundles themselves. After logging into the console, the user can select their username drop-down from the top-left corner of the navigation page and select the "My Profile" option. From there, the "New Client Bundle" link can be selected to create a client bundle and this will trigger a download of the bundle as a .zip file.
