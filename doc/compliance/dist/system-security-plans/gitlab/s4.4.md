# s4.4 - \[catalog\] Ensure images are scanned and rebuilt to include security patches

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

Images should be re-built ensuring that the latest version of the base images are used, to keep the operating system patch level at an appropriate level. Once the images have been re-built, containers should be re-started making use of the updated images.

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

All images that we are using are scanned by AWS because they are pulled
through the ECR pull-through cache.  The images are continuously scanned
by their Enhanced Scanning functionality, and our container development 
documentation tells us to consult the results when selecting images to build with.

Our container development documentation tells us to use the least-specific
image tag, so that every time a container is built, it will get the latest
security fixes.  For instance, instead of specifying `ruby:3.0.1`, we
instruct developers to use `ruby:3` or `ruby:3.0`.

All images are currently ephemeral, as a part of a CI pipeline, so
are built, run, and then either exit or are terminated after the pipeline
times out, so there are no containers to restart.
