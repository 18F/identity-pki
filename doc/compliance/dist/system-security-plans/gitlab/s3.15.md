# s3.15 - \[catalog\] Ensure that the Docker socket file ownership is set to root:docker

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

You should execute the following command:  ```  chown root:docker /var/run/docker.sock  ```  This sets the ownership to `root` and group ownership to `docker` for the default Docker socket file.

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

This is implemented automatically by the docker cookbook, and there is
a test that will fail if this ever changes.
