# s5.3 - \[catalog\] Ensure that Linux kernel capabilities are restricted within containers

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

You should execute the command below to add required capabilities:    ```  docker run --cap-add={"Capability 1","Capability 2"}     ```    You should execute the command below to remove unneeded capabilities:  ```  docker run --cap-drop={"Capability 1","Capability 2"}     ```  Alternatively, you could remove all the currently configured capabilities and then restore only the ones you specifically use:  ```  docker run --cap-drop=all --cap-add={"Capability 1","Capability 2"}     ```

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

We do not have the ability to remove capabilties from Gitlab-provided Redis and
Postgresql containers.

We do remove the `net_raw` capability from our own containers, and have a test
for this.
