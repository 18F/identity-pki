# ac-17.9 - \[catalog\] Disconnect / Disable Access

## Control Statement

The organization provides the capability to expeditiously disconnect or disable remote access to the information system within organization-defined time period.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[1\] defines the time period within which to expeditiously disconnect or disable remote access to the information system; and

- \[2\] provides the capability to expeditiously disconnect or disable remote access to the information system within the organization-defined time period.

## Control guidance

This control enhancement requires organizations to have the capability to rapidly disconnect current users remotely accessing the information system and/or disable further remote access. The speed of disconnect or disablement varies based on the criticality of missions/business functions and the need to eliminate immediate or future remote access to organizational information systems.

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

There are many ways to disconnect all users from GitLab, but the easiest would be to remove the GitLab instance from the load balancer through the AWS console or an aws-cli command. We can also log into the host itself and shut down GitLab and sshd, or just halt the GitLab server itself.
