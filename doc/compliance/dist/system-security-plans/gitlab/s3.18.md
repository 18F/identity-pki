# s3.18 - \[catalog\] Ensure that daemon.json file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

You should execute the command below  ```  chmod 644 /etc/docker/daemon.json  ```  This sets the file permissions for this file to `644`.

______________________________________________________________________

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

There is no `daemon.json` file, since the docker daemon is configured
entirely through the commandline that is used to launch it.
