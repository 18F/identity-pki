# s5.6 - \[catalog\] Ensure sshd is not run within containers

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

Uninstall the SSH daemon from the container and use and use `docker exec` to enter a container on the remote host.    ```  docker exec --interactive --tty $INSTANCE_ID sh  ```  OR  ```  docker attach $INSTANCE_ID  ```

______________________________________________________________________

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

We do not run the SSH daemon in our containers, and have a test for this.
