# ac-17.2 - \[catalog\] Protection of Confidentiality / Integrity Using Encryption

## Control Statement

The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to protect the confidentiality and integrity of remote access sessions.

## Control Objective

Determine if the information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to protect the confidentiality and integrity of remote access sessions.

## Control guidance

The encryption strength of mechanism is selected based on the security categorization of the information.

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

All connections to Gitlab either happen over the Web UI/API using HTTPS,
or over SSH.

The TLS ciphers and related controls are inherited from AWS' ATO, as we use their
load balancers and their managed TLS certificates.

Administrative access to GitLab UI/API, as well as all SSH accesss, require use of the GSA VPN which adds
an additional layer of TLS encryption between the client GFE and the GSA enterprise network.

The SSH encryption implementation uses a FIPS module for it's encryption,
thus ensuring we are using proper ciphers and hashes at proper strength.
