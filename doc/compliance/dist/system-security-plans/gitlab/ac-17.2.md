# ac-17.2 - \[catalog\] Protection of Confidentiality / Integrity Using Encryption

## Control Statement

The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to protect the confidentiality and integrity of remote access sessions.

## Control Objective

Determine if the information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to protect the confidentiality and integrity of remote access sessions.

## Control guidance

The encryption strength of mechanism is selected based on the security categorization of the information.

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

All connections to Gitlab either happen over the Web UI/API, or over
ssh, which require ssl or ssh encryption.  The SSL ciphers and related
controls are inherited from AWS' ATO, as we use their load balancers
and SSL certs.  The ssh encryption implementation is identical to what
we use in our idp systems, which uses a FIPS module for it's encryption,
thus ensuring we are using proper ciphers and hashes at proper strength.

Traffic is also encrypted using the GSA VPN between the GFE and the GSA.
