# dm-3 - \[catalog\] Minimization of PII Used in Testing, Training, and Research

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

The organization:  a.Develops policies and procedures that minimize the use of personally identifiable information (PII) for testing, training, and research; and  b.Implements controls to protect PII used for testing, training, and research.    Organizations often use PII for testing new applications or information systems prior to deployment. Organizations also use PII for research purposes and for training. The use of PII in testing, research, and training increases risk of unauthorized disclosure or misuse of the information. If PII must be used, organizations take measures to minimize any associated risks and to authorize the use of and limit the amount of PII for these purposes. Organizations consult with the SAOP/CPO and legal counsel to ensure that the use of PII in testing, training, and research is compatible with the original purpose for which it was collected.
