**Step 1**: Find out the file location:  ```  systemctl show -p FragmentPath docker.socket  ```    **Step 2**: If the file does not exist, this recommendation is not applicable. If the file does exist, you should execute the command below, including the correct file path to set the file permissions to `644`.    For example,  ```  chmod 644 /usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.socket  ```
