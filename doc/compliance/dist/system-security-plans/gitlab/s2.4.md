# s2.4 - \[catalog\] Ensure insecure registries are not used

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

You should ensure that no insecure registries are in use.

______________________________________________________________________

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

Our outbound proxies limit what registries we are able to access,
and we make sure that we put only good quality registries in that
list.
