# s2.2 - \[catalog\] Ensure the logging level is set to 'info'

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

Ensure that the Docker daemon configuration file has the following configuration included    ```  "log-level": "info"  ```    Alternatively, run the Docker daemon as below:  ```  dockerd --log-level="info"  ```

______________________________________________________________________

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

The runner recipe in the identity-gitlab cookbook sets the log-level
to "debug", and there is a test which checks this.
