# s2.15 - \[catalog\] Ensure that a daemon-wide custom seccomp profile is applied if appropriate

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

By default, Docker's default seccomp profile is applied. If this is adequate for your environment, no action is necessary. Alternatively, if you choose to apply your own seccomp profile, use the `--seccomp-profile` flag at daemon start or put it in the daemon runtime parameters file.    ```  dockerd --seccomp-profile   ```
