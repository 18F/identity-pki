# s2.8 - \[catalog\] Enable user namespace support

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

Please consult the Docker documentation for various ways in which this can be configured depending upon your requirements. Your steps might also vary based on platform - For example, on Red Hat, sub-UIDs and sub-GIDs mapping creation do not work automatically. You might have to create your own mapping.    The high-level steps are as below:    **Step 1:** Ensure that the files `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid` exist.  ```  touch /etc/subuid /etc/subgid   ```  **Step 2:** Start the docker daemon with `--userns-remap` flag  ```  dockerd --userns-remap=default  ```
