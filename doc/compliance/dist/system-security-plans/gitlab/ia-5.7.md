# ia-5.7 - \[catalog\] No Embedded Unencrypted Static Authenticators

## Control Statement

The organization ensures that unencrypted static authenticators are not embedded in applications or access scripts or stored on function keys.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization ensures that unencrypted static authenticators are not:

- \[1\] embedded in applications;

- \[2\] embedded in access scripts; or

- \[3\] stored on function keys.

## Control guidance

Organizations exercise caution in determining whether embedded or stored authenticators are in encrypted or unencrypted form. If authenticators are used in the manner stored, then those representations are considered unencrypted authenticators. This is irrespective of whether that representation is perhaps an encrypted version of something else (e.g., a password).
