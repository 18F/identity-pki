# s4.1 - \[catalog\] Ensure that a user for the container has been created

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

You should ensure that the Dockerfile for each container image contains the information below:  ```  USER   ```  In this case, the user name or ID refers to the user that was found in the container base image. If there is no specific user created in the container base image, then make use of the `useradd` command to add a specific user before the `USER` instruction in the Dockerfile.    For example, add the below lines in the Dockerfile to create a user in the container:  ```  RUN useradd -d /home/username -m -s /bin/bash username  USER username   ```  Note: If there are users in the image that are not needed, you should consider deleting them. After deleting those users, commit the image and then generate new instances of the containers.    Alternatively, if it is not possible to set the `USER` directive in the Dockerfile, a script running as part of the `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` sections of the Dockerfile should be used to ensure that the container process switches to a non-root user.
