# s3.2 - \[catalog\] Ensure that docker.service file permissions are appropriately set

## Control Statement

## Control Objective

**Step 1**: Find out the file location:  ```  systemctl show -p FragmentPath docker.service  ```    **Step 2**: If the file does not exist, this recommendation is not applicable. If the file exists, execute the command below including the correct file path to set the file permissions to `644`.    For example,  ```  chmod 644 /usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service  ```

______________________________________________________________________

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

/etc/systemd/system/docker.service is set to permissions 644 by default.
There is also a test for this that will fail if it goes out of compliance.
