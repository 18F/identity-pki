Read a terraform plan text from FILE (or stdin), and print all of the targets
that it names for addition, destruction, or modification (all lines that start
with "+", "-", or "~").

This is useful if you want a list of all -target resource names that a plan
produces.

Examples:

    terraform plan | $0
EOM
}

case $# in
    0)
        # read from stdin if it's not a TTY
        if [ -t 0 ]; then
            usage
            exit 1
        else
            file='-'
        fi
        ;;
    1)
        file="$1"
        ;;
    *)
        usage
        exit 1
        ;;

cat -- "$file" | grep '^[+~-]' | cut -f2 -d' ' | while read -r line; do
    echo -n "-target $line "
