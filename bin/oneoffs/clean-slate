$(howto)

Runs all necessary tasks to tear down the basic infrastructure for an AWS account.
Ideally, should only be used when resetting an account back to a clean slate and
then repopulating it with the resources in the terraform/all directory.

MUST be run as an IAM user (/not/ an assumed role) within said account,
which has the AdministrativeAccess IAM policy attached,
identified in ~/.aws/config as \`IAM_USER_PROFILE_NAME\` (required argument).

The tasks in this script can also be individually executed as follows:

  -s, -1 : Removes all objects + versions from the account's 'secrets' S3 buckets,
           allowing Terraform to delete the buckets when the 'destroy' operation runs.
           (Step: 1_empty_secrets_buckets)
  -m, -2 : Removes both 'tf-state' modules from state, as many of their resources
           have prevent_destroy = true and will be deleted later in the script anyway.
           (Step: 2_rm_state_module)
  -x, -3 : Runs 'terraform destroy' to delete all other resources that are defined
           in the terraform/all directory.
           (Step: 3_tf_destroy_all)
  -b, -4 : Empties and deletes any S3 buckets that remain in the account, which
           includes the 's3-access-logs' and 'tf-state' buckets.
           (Step: 4_rm_remaining_buckets)
  -t, -5 : Deletes the \`terraform_locks\` DynamoDB table from the account.
           (Step: 5_delete_tf_locks_table)
  -h     : Displays this help
