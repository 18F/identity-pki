Usage: $(basename "$0") <environment>

Print version information about the latest terraform/app applied to the given
environment. This metadata includes git revision and timestamp info about the
last terraform apply that was done from identity-devops:/terraform/app/.

This information is stored in S3 next to the terraform state files. Terraform
apply will automatically change this information when it is run.

See https://github.com/18F/identity-devops/tree/master/doc/process/releases.md
for more details about our release tools.
